We analyzed four major airlines American Airlines (AAL), Delta Airlines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) to find out how bad the airline industry got hit by the 2020 COVID pandemic, and which (if any) of these companies ended up a winner. We looked directly at their stock performances from 2000-2023 to find our results. We also seek to answer, what do we anticipate for the future of these select airlines? 

Since we sought to find out how bad Covid19 impacted the airline industry as well as to find out and show how the ‘end’ of Covid19 pandemic affected the market Cap for these airlines. We pulled our stock information from Yahoo finance’s API and with a line graph we show that the market cap collapsed 60% to show visually how bad these airlines got hit on March 16th, 2020 also referred to as the second black Monday.

We then show the Winners and Losers for each by showing how the market cap changed, what happened to the market during covid and how the companies recovered. For this topic we show a stacked line graph to show the percent of market cap by each airline. Followed by a pie chart that shows the market cap distribution. 

We then make our predicts for the future. We do this by using a bar graph that shows the market share change from December 2019 to December 2022. The graph is then used to make future predictions about the where the airline industry is going.
Finally we use linear regression charts to make continued future predictions.
